## About the Project
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improving survival rates. This project leverages data science and machine learning to create a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis.

Key objectives of this project include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the data to gain insights and identify patterns.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features and creating new ones if necessary.
Model Building: Developing machine learning models for breast cancer prediction.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
Deployment (Optional): Deploying the model for real-time predictions.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found here. It contains features extracted from breast cancer biopsies, including various measurements and characteristics.

##Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Ensure you have the necessary dataset (provided in the Dataset section).

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building.

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

(Optional) Deploy the model for real-time breast cancer predictions.
